### Summary of Python Projects

#### Project 1 (`P1.py`):
- **Author**: Yeamin Chowdhury
- **Date**: 02/25/2023
- **Description**: 
  - This is a database management system capable of creating, deleting, and altering databases and tables.
  - It uses the `os` and `shutil` modules for operating system interaction and file operations, respectively.
  - The main function takes input from the user and processes commands until '.exit' is entered, indicating the end of the session.

#### Project 2 (`P2.py`):
- **Author**: Yeamin Chowdhury
- **Date**: 04/03/2023
- **Description**: 
  - This program extends the functionality of the first project by allowing the creation, deletion, and modification of databases and tables.
  - It introduces capabilities to insert, delete, and update records in the tables.
  - Users can select records from the tables based on given conditions.
  - It continues to use the `os` and `shutil` modules.

#### Project 3 (`P3.py`):
- **Author**: Yeamin Chowdhury
- **Date**: 04/03/2023
- **Description**: 
  - This version of the database management system adds functionality for joining tables.
  - It supports default inner join, explicit inner join, and left outer join operations on tables.
  - Selection of data from tables is also possible.
  - The `os` and `shutil` modules are used for file and operating system operations.

#### Project 4 (`P4.py`):
- **Author**: Yeamin Chowdhury
- **Date**: 05/15/2023
- **Description**: 
  - This project introduces transaction handling with locks.
  - It uses the `os`, `shutil`, and `fileinput` modules for operating system interaction, file operations, and file input handling, respectively.
  - It appears to manage transactions by maintaining a global state, possibly for handling concurrency and ensuring data integrity during transactions.

Each project progressively builds upon the previous one, adding more complex database management features like record manipulation, join operations, and transaction handling with locks. The use of the `os` and `shutil` modules is consistent across the projects, indicating a focus on file and directory operations integral to database management systems.
